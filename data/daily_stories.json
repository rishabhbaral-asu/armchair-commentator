      "body": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 It is a battle of narratives as much as football. On one sideline stands Sam Darnold, the once-discarded prospect who found salvation in Seattle. Under Mike Macdonald's system, Darnold threw for 4,200 yards and 32 touchdowns this season, unlocking the terrifying potential of DK Metcalf and Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n\nOpposite him is the future: Drake Maye. The Patriots' sophomore sensation has evoked memories of Brady, leading New England back to the promised land in just his second year. Maye's connection with his receiving corps has been lethal in the playoffs, dismantling the Chiefs and Ravens on the road.\n\nKickoff is set for 4:30 PM MST on NBC. The Seahawks are currently 2.5-point favorites.",

They held a three-point lead with four minutes remaining, silencing the CU Events Center. But gasping lungs and missed free throws eventually doomed them to a 78-70 loss against the Buffaloes.\n\nSenior point guard Moe Odum was electric, pouring in 23 points and dishing 5 assists. He repeatedly attacked Colorado's 7-foot interior, finding freshman center Massamba Diop (19 pts, 7 rebs) for easy dunks. But when the game tightened, Colorado's depth took over.",
