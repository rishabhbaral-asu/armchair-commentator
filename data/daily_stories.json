Seattle's defense, led by head coach Mike Macdonald, recorded seven sacks and forced three turnovers, holding the high-powered New England offense to season lows in total yards (240) and points (13).\n\nThe Patriots entered the game averaging 28.4 points per contest but were stifled by Seattle's simulated pressures. Drake Maye, the NFL MVP runner-up, was harassed constantly, finishing 18-of-41 passing.\n\nSeattle's offense was efficient. Sam Darnold threw for 215 yards and two scores, while Kenneth Walker III rushed for 112 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTOP PERFORMERS: Sam Darnold completed 22 of 28 passes for 215 yards and 2 TDs. Kenneth Walker III averaged 5.1 yards per carry. \nFor New England, Ja'Lynn Polk caught 6 passes for 84 yards.\n\nINJURIES: Seahawks: Abraham Lucas: active (knee). Patriots: Cole Strange: out (knee).",

Chasing a modest target, India collapsed to 34/4 inside the powerplay before Yadav (84*) anchored the innings. \n\nThe United States, playing in their first World Cup on Indian soil, utilized the swinging conditions effectively early.
