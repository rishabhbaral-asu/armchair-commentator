      "body": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 The dynasty talk was premature. The coronation was cancelled. In a defensive masterclass that suffocated the league's highest-flying offense, the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to win Super Bowl LX, capturing the franchise's second Lombardi Trophy in a game that felt like a throwback to a different era of football.\n\nIt wasn't the shootout the pundits predicted. Instead, Mike Macdonald's defense turned Drake Maye's dream season into a recurring nightmare under the lights of Levi's Stadium. The Seahawks sacked the Patriots' sophomore quarterback seven times, holding New England to a season-low 240 total yards and forcing three critical turnovers that sucked the life out of the Patriots' sideline.\n\n\"We heard the noise,\" Macdonald said, clutching the trophy, his voice cracking with emotion. \"For two weeks, all we heard was 'Drake Maye this' and 'New England Offense that.' Nobody talked about our front seven. Nobody talked about our discipline. I think they're talking now.\"\n\nThe narrative entering the week focused on the Patriots' explosive youth, but it was Seattle's veteran castoffs who defined the evening. Sam Darnold, completing one of the most remarkable career renaissance arcs in NFL history, was surgical. He finished 22-of-28 for 215 yards and two touchdowns, avoiding the critical mistakes that once plagued his tenure in New York and Carolina.\n\nThe turning point came late in the second quarter. Trailing 9-6, the Patriots drove to the Seattle 5-yard line, poised to take the lead. On 3rd-and-goal, Maye dropped back and was immediately swallowed up by Leonard Williams for a 12-yard sack. New England was forced to settle for a field goal. Seattle responded with a methodical, soul-crushing 75-yard touchdown drive. Kenneth Walker III (112 yards, 1 TD) bludgeoned the Patriots' defensive front, ripping off runs of 12, 8, and 15 yards before punching it in. That swing\u2014from a potential Patriots lead to a Seahawks dominance\u2014broke New England's spirit.\n\nBy the fourth quarter, the Patriots looked exhausted. Their offensive line, which had been stellar all postseason, crumbled under the weight of Seattle's simulated pressures. As the clock hit zero, blue and green confetti rained down, signaling the dawn of a new era in the NFC West.",

The Phoenix Suns (32-20) host the Los Angeles Lakers (30-22) in a matchup that pits mid-range precision against brute force in the paint.\n\nThe Suns enter the contest riding a wave of offensive efficiency. They have transformed into the league's premier jump-shooting team, leading the NBA in shooting percentage from 10-16 feet (48%). Devin Booker has been the catalyst, averaging 34.5 points per game in February while acting as the primary playmaker.\n\nConversely, the Lakers live in the restricted area. They average a league-high 58 points in the paint, utilizing the sheer size of Anthony Davis and the driving ability of LeBron James to collapse defenses.\n\nThe matchup to watch is undeniably Anthony Davis vs. Jusuf Nurkic. In their last meeting, Nurkic's physicality frustrated Davis, holding him to a 6-for-19 shooting night. However, Davis has been on a tear since the All-Star break. If Phoenix is forced to send double-teams at Davis, it leaves them vulnerable to Austin Reaves and D'Angelo Russell on the perimeter.\n\nInjury Report: Bradley Beal is a game-time decision with an ankle sprain. For the Lakers, Jarred Vanderbilt remains out.",
