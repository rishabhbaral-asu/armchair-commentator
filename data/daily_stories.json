In a defensive masterclass that stifled one of the league's most potent offenses, the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to win Super Bowl LX. Mike Macdonald's defense turned Drake Maye's dream season into a nightmare, recording seven sacks and forcing three turnovers.\n\nSam Darnold was efficient, throwing for 215 yards and two touchdowns, finding a rhythm early that the Patriots could not match. Kenneth Walker III added 112 yards on the ground, controlling the clock and the tempo.",
