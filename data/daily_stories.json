The coronation was cancelled. In a defensive masterclass that stifled one of the league's most potent offenses, the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to win Super Bowl LX. Mike Macdonald's defense turned Drake Maye's dream season into a nightmare, recording seven sacks and forcing three turnovers.\n\n\"Nobody talked about our front seven,\" Macdonald said postgame. \"I think they're talking now.\"\n\nThe Patriots entered the game averaging 28.4 points per contest but were held to season lows in total yards (240) and points (13). Seattle's simulated pressures confused the sophomore quarterback all night.\n\nOffensively, Sam Darnold exorcised the ghosts of his past. The veteran signal-caller was surgical, completing 22-of-28 passes for 215 yards and two touchdowns, finding a rhythm early that New England could not disrupt.\n\nTOP PERFORMERS: Kenneth Walker III (SEA) pounded the rock for 112 yards and a touchdown. Sam Darnold (SEA) finished with a 115.4 passer rating. Ja'Lynn Polk (NE) provided the lone spark for New England with 6 catches for 84 yards.\n\nINJURIES: Cole Strange (NE) left in the 2nd Quarter (knee).",

Chasing a modest target of 133, the powerhouse Indian lineup crumbled to 34/4 inside the powerplay, silenced by a spirited American bowling attack utilizing the swinging conditions at Wankhede.\n\nEnter Suryakumar Yadav. The captain played a knock for the ages, abandoning his usual flamboyant style for a gritty, unbeaten 84 off 48 balls. He anchored partnerships with the lower order, slowly shifting the momentum back to the hosts before exploding in the final overs to secure victory by 7 wickets.\n\n\"We knew the new ball would do a bit,\" Yadav admitted. \"But credit to the USA, they put us under immense pressure.\"\n\nTOP PERFORMERS: Suryakumar Yadav (IND) scored 84* (48). Arshdeep Singh (IND) tore through the USA top order with 4/18. Steven Taylor (USA) top-scored for the visitors with a counter-attacking 42.\n\nINJURIES: None reported.",
